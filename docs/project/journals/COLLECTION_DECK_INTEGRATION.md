# Collection-Deck Integration Design Journal
**Date:** July 31, 2025
**Phase:** Planning & Design
**Status:** Concept Development

## üéØ Core Integration Requirements

### **Bidirectional Collection-Deck Awareness**

#### **Collection View Enhancements:**
- **Deck Usage Indicators**: Cards show which decks they're allocated to
- **Available Quantity Display**: Show "3 owned, 2 in decks, 1 available"
- **Multi-Deck Allocation**: Track when same card is used across multiple decks
- **Reserved Card Warning**: Alert when trying to use cards already allocated

#### **Deck Building Intelligence:**
- **Ownership Status**: Cards marked as "Have", "Need", or "Getting"
- **Availability Check**: Real-time validation against available collection
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommend similar cards you own when desired card unavailable
- **Quantity Conflicts**: Prevent overallocation of limited cards

## üîß Technical Implementation Concepts

### **Database Schema Additions:**
```sql
-- Track card allocation across decks
ALTER TABLE deck_cards ADD COLUMN reserved_from_collection BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;

-- Collection availability tracking
ALTER TABLE collection ADD COLUMN available_quantity INT GENERATED AS (quantity - allocated_quantity);
ALTER TABLE collection ADD COLUMN allocated_quantity INT DEFAULT 0;

-- Deck completion tracking
ALTER TABLE decks ADD COLUMN completion_status ENUM('complete', 'partial', 'wishlist') DEFAULT 'wishlist';
ALTER TABLE decks ADD COLUMN missing_cards_count INT DEFAULT 0;

-- Advanced search support
CREATE TABLE saved_searches (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  search_criteria JSON NOT NULL,
  is_template BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Search result caching for performance
CREATE TABLE search_cache (
  cache_key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  result_data JSON NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Card visual variants tracking
ALTER TABLE cards ADD COLUMN frame_effects JSON; -- borderless, extended_art, showcase, etc.
ALTER TABLE cards ADD COLUMN promo_types JSON; -- prerelease, fnm, gameday, etc.
ALTER TABLE cards ADD COLUMN finishes JSON; -- foil, nonfoil, etched, etc.
```

### **Search Query Structure:**
```javascript
// Example complex search query
{
  "filters": {
    "sets": ["fdn"], // Foundations
    "frameEffects": ["borderless", "extended_art"],
    "owned": false, // Not in collection
    "colors": {"operator": "OR", "values": ["R", "G"]},
    "cmc": {"min": 3, "max": 6},
    "types": {"include": ["Creature"], "exclude": ["Token"]}
  },
  "sort": [
    {"field": "name", "direction": "asc"},
    {"field": "cmc", "direction": "asc"}
  ],
  "export": {
    "format": "txt",
    "columns": ["name", "set", "collector_number", "rarity"],
    "groupBy": "rarity",
    "includeHeaders": true,
    "priceData": false
  }
}
```

### **API Endpoints for Integration:**
- `GET /api/collection/{cardId}/availability` - Check available quantities
- `POST /api/decks/{deckId}/validate` - Validate deck against collection
- `PUT /api/collection/allocate` - Reserve cards for deck building
- `GET /api/decks/{deckId}/missing` - Get missing cards list
- `GET /api/collection/allocated` - See all reserved cards

### **Advanced Search API Endpoints:**
