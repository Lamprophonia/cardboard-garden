### Today's Accomplishments

#### Maven Configuration Resolution
- **Problem**: Spring Boot application failed to start due to corrupted Maven settings
- **Root Cause**: `~/.m2/settings.xml` contained references to unavailable Pentaho repositories
- **Solution**: Deleted the problematic settings.xml file to restore default Maven Central repository access
- **Result**: Maven dependency resolution now working correctly, all Spring Boot dependencies downloading successfully

#### Spring Boot Application Progress
- **Status**: Application successfully compiles and starts
- **Achievements**:
  - Maven clean operation successful
  - Spring Boot 3.2.2 with Java 17 runtime established
  - Embedded Tomcat server configured on port 3001
  - Database connection to MySQL established via HikariPool
  - Spring Security configuration active
  - DevTools enabled for development

#### Database Schema Issues Identified
- **Current Blocker**: Hibernate schema validation error
- **Specific Issue**: `cards.id` column type mismatch
  - Database has: `varchar` (Types#VARCHAR)
  - JPA Entity expects: `bigint` (Types#BIGINT)
- **Next Steps**: Need to align database schema with JPA entity definitions

#### Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.2, Java 17, Maven 3.x
- **Database**: MySQL with Hibernate 6.4.1.Final
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with Spring Security
- **Development**: Spring DevTools, embedded Tomcat

### Key Learnings
1. Corporate Maven settings can interfere with project builds when external repositories become unavailable
2. Deleting `~/.m2/settings.xml` restores default Maven behavior for standard projects
3. Spring Boot startup sequence is robust - can identify specific failure points in database schema validation

### Next Session Priorities
1. Resolve database schema validation errors for `cards` table
2. Investigate other potential schema mismatches
3. Consider Hibernate auto-DDL configuration vs manual schema updates
4. Complete Spring Boot application startup testing

### Future Feature Roadmap

## üéâ **MILESTONE: Complete Theme System Implementation** (August 1, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Professional light/dark theme switching with CSS variables and smooth transitions
- ‚úÖ Fixed all hardcoded white backgrounds across components (main content, sidebar, footer)  
- ‚úÖ ThemeProvider context with localStorage persistence and system preference detection
- ‚úÖ Streamlined to two themes (Light/Dark) removing unnecessary high contrast option
- ‚úÖ Optimal button sizing preventing text wrapping and layout issues
- **Future Architecture**: Theme toggle migration from header to user settings (authenticated users only)

## üè† **Core Collection System: "Bookshelf Metaphor"** (Primary Development Focus)

### **Collection Hierarchy Architecture**
**üè† Bookshelves** (TCG-Specific Organization):
- Separate collections for each trading card game (Magic, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc.)
- Visual bookshelf representation with customizable aesthetics
- Multi-game support building on existing Magic foundation (108,809+ cards)

**üìñ Binders** (Rich Detail & Customization):
- Detailed card information with visual binder interface
- Flexible organization: by set (default), custom splits, or user preference
- Example: Single Aetherdrift binder vs separate Commander/Variants binders
- **Check-out System**: Cards can be removed and replaced with proxy markers
- Proxy cards reference which deck currently contains the physical card
- Prevents accidental double-allocation of single cards

**üì¶ Bulk Boxes** (Minimal Data, Maximum Search):
- Simplified storage for large quantities of common cards
- Focus on essential data: name, quantity, basic search metadata
- Robust search functionality for quick bulk card lookups
- Mirrors real-life bulk collection management

**üéí Bags** (Format-Specific Organization):
