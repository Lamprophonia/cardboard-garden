# Cardboard Garden - Project Journal

> **A living document tracking the evolution, decisions, and future plans of this project**

---

## 📅 **Project Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (July 2025)**

#### **Initial Setup**
- **Started with**: Empty project structure (`app/`, `data/`, `sql/`)
- **First question**: "hows it look" - project was essentially blank slate
- **Decision**: "maybe we start with building databases and tables?"

#### **Database Architecture Evolution**

**🔄 Unified Approach (Initial)**
- Started with single database approach
- Created comprehensive schema with all games in one DB
- **Challenge discovered**: Game-specific attributes (Pokemon HP, Magic power/toughness, Yu-Gi-Oh ATK/DEF)
- **Quote**: "what about details of the cards, like power and toughness, that are unique to one game?"

**🔄 Game-Specific Exploration**
- Explored separate databases per game
- **User question**: "could you include lorcana in your consideration?"
- Added Disney Lorcana support (ink costs, lore values, franchise characters)
- **User question**: "would it not be benefitial to give each game a completely separate DB?"

**✅ Hybrid Architecture (Final Decision)**
- **User interest**: "i am interested in the hybrid approach, elaborate please"
- **Final decision**: "I would like to move forward with this hybrid approach"
- **Architecture**: Shared infrastructure + game-specific optimized databases

#### **File Organization & Cleanup**
- **User concern**: "should we first clean up the other files?"
- **User decision**: "if we decided on the hybrid approach, is the unified approach redundant?"
- Cleaned up conflicting files, organized into logical structure

#### **Security & Production Readiness**
- **User question**: "are there any other best practices we might consider? like users, or permissions, etc?"
- Implemented comprehensive security with 3-tier user system
- Added performance optimization, backup procedures, monitoring
- Created extensive documentation

## 🏗️ **Technical Decisions Made**

### **Architecture Decisions**

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Hybrid Database Architecture** | Balance performance vs flexibility | 5 databases: shared + 4 game-specific |
| **MySQL/MariaDB** | Mature, well-supported, excellent for relational data | UTF8MB4 support, stored procedures |
| **3-Tier Security Model** | Principle of least privilege | App, readonly, backup users with specific permissions |
| **Game-Specific Optimization** | Each TCG has unique attributes and query patterns | Pokemon HP/types, Magic mana costs, Yu-Gi-Oh levels, Lorcana ink |

### **Database Design Principles**
- **Normalized design** to eliminate redundancy
- **Composite indexes** for performance
- **Foreign key constraints** for data integrity
- **Stored procedures** for complex operations
- **Audit trails** for security and debugging

### **Files Removed During Cleanup**
- Redundant unified approach files
- Duplicate schemas
- Conflicting documentation

---

## 🔐 **Security Implementation**

### **User Management**
- **`tcg_app`**: Application user with CRUD permissions
- **`tcg_readonly`**: Analytics/reporting user (SELECT only)
- **`tcg_backup`**: Backup operations (SELECT + LOCK TABLES)

### **Security Features**
- Password complexity requirements
- Connection limits per user
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure backup procedures
- Regular security health checks

### **Security Best Practices Implemented**
- Principle of least privilege
- No direct root access for applications
- Encrypted connections (SSL/TLS ready)
- Regular password rotation procedures
- Monitoring and alerting systems

---

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Indexing Strategy**
- **Composite indexes** for common query patterns
- **Card lookups**: (game_id, set_id, card_number)
- **Collection queries**: (user_id, game_id)
- **Market tracking**: (card_id, price_date)

### **Maintenance Procedures**
- **UpdateMarketPrices**: Automated market data refresh
- **CleanupOldWishlistItems**: Remove fulfilled wishlist entries
- **GetCollectionStats**: Performance collection summaries
- **Health checks**: Database integrity monitoring
