# Development Journals

This directory contains detailed development session journals and progress documentation for the Cardboard Garden project.

## Current Journals

### Active Development Sessions
- `DEV_SESSION_2025_07_31.md` - Maven configuration resolution and Spring Boot startup progress

### Journal Format
Each development session should include:
- Session overview and objectives
- Technical context and environment
- Issues encountered and resolutions
- Progress made and outcomes
- Next steps and priorities

## Usage
- Create new journal entries for significant development sessions
- Document major milestones and technical decisions
- Reference journal entries in commit messages for historical context
- Keep sessions focused on actual implementation work rather than theoretical planning

## Archive Policy
- Empty planning documents have been removed in favor of actual implementation journals
- Focus on documenting real development progress and technical solutions
- Historical context is maintained in the main PROJECT_JOURNAL.md file
