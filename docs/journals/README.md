# TCG Card Collection Manager - Journal Archive

This directory contains detailed development journals organized by project phases.

## **Journal Organization**

### **Master Journal**
- **[../PROJECT_JOURNAL.md](../PROJECT_JOURNAL.md)** - Current phase overview and project summary

### **Phase Journals** (Detailed Development History)

| Phase | Period | Focus | Status | Journal File |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | July 2025 | Database Architecture | ✅ Complete | [PHASE1_DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md](PHASE1_DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| **Phase 2** | Future | API Development | 📋 Planned | `PHASE2_API_DEVELOPMENT.md` |
| **Phase 3** | Future | Frontend/UI | 📋 Planned | `PHASE3_FRONTEND_UI.md` |
| **Phase 4** | Future | Deployment & Production | 📋 Planned | `PHASE4_DEPLOYMENT.md` |

## **When to Create New Phase Journals**

### **Start a new phase journal when:**
- Beginning a major new development area (API, Frontend, etc.)
- Current journal exceeds ~400 lines
- Focus shifts to entirely different technical domain
- Major architectural decisions need dedicated space

### **Journal Naming Convention:**
- `PHASE{N}_{FOCUS_AREA}.md`
- Use UPPERCASE for consistency
- Keep phase numbers sequential
- Use descriptive focus area names

## **Master Journal Management**

The main `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` should:
- ✅ Contain project overview and current status
- ✅ Link to detailed phase journals
- ✅ Track overall project metrics
- ✅ Maintain recent updates section (last 2-3 phases)
- ✅ Archive older detailed entries to phase journals

## **Cross-Journal References**

Use relative links to reference between journals:
```markdown
See [Phase 1 Database Decisions](journals/PHASE1_DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md#technical-decisions-made)
```

## **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **📚 Organized History**: Each phase has dedicated detailed documentation
2. **🔍 Easy Navigation**: Master journal provides quick overview
3. **📈 Scalable**: Can handle years of development without becoming unwieldy
4. **👥 Team Friendly**: New team members can focus on relevant phases
5. **📊 Portfolio Ready**: Each phase journal showcases specific skills
