# Development Session - July 31, 2025

## Session Overview
**Duration**: Development troubleshooting session  
**Focus**: Spring Boot application startup and Maven configuration issues  
**Outcome**: Maven issues resolved, database schema validation identified as next blocker  

## Technical Context
- **Project**: Cardboard Garden API (Spring Boot)
- **Environment**: Windows development environment
- **IDE**: VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- **Key Technologies**: Spring Boot 3.2.2, Java 17, Maven, MySQL, Hibernate

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### 1. Maven Repository Configuration Failure
**Problem**: 
- Spring Boot application unable to start
- Maven dependency resolution failing
- All dependency downloads blocked

**Investigation**:
- Identified corrupted `~/.m2/settings.xml` file
- Found references to unavailable Pentaho repositories
- Maven unable to fallback to Central repository

**Resolution**:
```bash
# Deleted problematic settings file
rm ~/.m2/settings.xml

# Verified Maven clean operation
mvn clean

# Successfully ran Spring Boot application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Outcome**: ✅ Maven now properly resolves dependencies from Maven Central

### 2. Spring Boot Startup Progression
**Achievements**:
- Application compiles successfully
- Spring Boot banner displays correctly
- Embedded Tomcat starts on port 3001
- Database connection pool (HikariPool-1) established
- Spring Security configuration loads
- DevTools configuration active

**Current Status**: Application reaches database schema validation phase

### 3. Database Schema Validation Error
**Current Blocker**:
```
Schema-validation: wrong column type encountered in column [id] in table [cards]; 
found [varchar (Types#VARCHAR)], but expecting [bigint (Types#BIGINT)]
```

**Analysis**:
- Hibernate expects `bigint` for entity ID fields
- Database currently has `varchar` for `cards.id` column
- This is a common issue when JPA entities don't match existing database schema

**Potential Solutions**:
1. Update database schema to use `bigint` for ID columns
2. Modify JPA entities to match existing database types
3. Configure Hibernate to auto-update schema
4. Use Hibernate's `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` setting

## Files Modified/Reviewed
- `~/.m2/settings.xml` (deleted)
- `api-java/pom.xml` (verified configuration)
- Spring Boot application logs (analyzed)
- `JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint.java` (reviewed security config)

## Command History
```bash
mvn clean                                                   # ✅ Successful
mvn spring-boot:run                                        # ✅ Partial success
# Application starts but fails on schema validation
```

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Resolve `cards.id` column type mismatch
2. **Database Review**: Check for other potential schema mismatches
3. **Configuration**: Decide on schema management strategy (manual vs auto-DDL)
4. **Testing**: Complete application startup and basic endpoint testing

## Development Notes
- Maven issues completely resolved - focus shifts to database schema
- Spring Boot startup sequence working correctly until schema validation
- JWT security configuration appears properly structured
- Development environment is now stable for continued work

## Session Wrap-up
**Completed**: Maven configuration restoration  
**In Progress**: Database schema alignment  
**Next Session**: Continue with schema validation resolution
